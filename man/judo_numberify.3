.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f[B]judo_numberify\f[R](3) function converts a lexeme of a JSON number into its floating-point representation.
The argument \f[I]lexeme\f[R] must point to a valid lexeme and \f[I]length\f[R] must be the lexemeâ€™s length in UTF-8 code units.
The implementation writes the floating-point value to \f[I]number\f[R].
