Retrieves the next element of an array from \f[I]value\f[R], which must be an element of an array.
If \f[I]value\f[R] is NULL or itâ€™s the last element of the array, then NULL is returned.
To ensure that \f[I]value\f[R] is always an element of an array, only pass elements to this function that were retrieved from either \f[B]judo_first\f[R](3) or \f[B]judo_next\f[R](3).
